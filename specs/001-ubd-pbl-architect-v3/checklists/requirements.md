# Specification Quality Checklist: UbD-PBL 课程架构师 V3

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Summary**:
- All 16 validation items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Specification is complete and ready for next phase

**Detailed Review**:

1. **Content Quality** (4/4 passed):
   - The spec focuses on WHAT (user needs, business value) not HOW (technical implementation)
   - Written in plain language accessible to teachers and product stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
   - No framework/language/database specifics mentioned

2. **Requirement Completeness** (8/8 passed):
   - 33 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-033) are all testable and unambiguous
   - 10 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-010) are measurable with specific metrics
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "complete task in 45 minutes", "85% quality", "NPS ≥40")
   - 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
   - 7 edge cases identified and described
   - 8 assumptions clearly documented
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete

3. **Feature Readiness** (4/4 passed):
   - Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
   - User stories cover all three core modules plus project management
   - All success criteria can be verified without knowing implementation details
   - Spec maintains focus on user experience and business outcomes

## Notes

- Spec is well-structured with clear separation between three UbD-PBL modules
- Assumptions section appropriately documents AI model capabilities and user context
- Edge cases cover important scenarios (AI failure, concurrent editing, empty states)
- Success criteria include both quantitative (time, percentages) and qualitative (user satisfaction, expert review) metrics
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional, as no clarifications needed) or `/speckit.plan`

## Next Steps

✅ **Recommended**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
⚠️ **Optional**: Run `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders want to refine specific aspects
